## Surreal Estate
 This is a react project to create a property search engine that will have multiple pages:
  * A listing page where you can search for different properties and sort/filter the results.
  * An add property page where you will add new properties
  * A property page
Properties will come from an API that we have created
## Concept
 We are going to implement the project using the following concepts;
  * Single Page Application (SPA)
  * Client-side Routing
  * Controlled Inputs
  * HTTP Requests
  * API Interaction
  * OAut

  ## Interracting with the project
   To just interact with this app, please .....


  Or you can just code along with me:
## Getting Started
``` run npx-create-react-app surreal estate ```

## After running npx-create-react-app surreal estate
* got to the public folder
 * delete all the files except html file
   * in html file, delete, all the comments, favicon link and manifest
   * change the title to surreal-estate

* goto src folder
  **remove the serviceWorker.js and SVG file - app will crash at this point
  * *open *index.js* which is our app entry point
    * delete comments, serviceWorker import and serviceWorker.unregister(); 
  * open *App.js* and replace everything within the div with 'Surreal Estate' in h2 tag

## /src file structure
In src, create 3 folders: *components*, *tests* & *styles*
 * move *App.js*, *App.test.js* & *App.css* into them respectively
 * /src now contains index.js, index.css and the configuration file that powers our test suite- setupTests.js
 * now update import paths by following the failed to compile errors in the browser, delete useless import paths too (remember logo.svg? delete the import path, its the reason 'Surreal Estate' in h2 tag has not been rendered before we started changing src file structure)
 * delete all the styles in App.css
 * run ```npm test```
   * change import path for *App* & 'learn react' to 'surreal estate'
   ** test should pass now 
   
## Initialise a git repo
Stage, commit and push

## Add a Google font
In the main or first loading CSS file, in our own case, the *index.css* at the very top of the page, just do: 
* ``` @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Nunito:400,700'); ```

* in the body, do:
```
body {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  font-family: 'Nunito', cursive;
};
```
* Import this into *index.js* :
``` import './index.css'; ```

## Eslint & Airbnb style guide
In any other project we would start by installing eslint as one of of dev dependencies however, since we are using create-react-app this dependency is already included. We do need to install a few other though: 
``` "eslint-config-airbnb": "^18.2.0",
    "eslint-plugin-import": "^2.22.0",
    "eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y": "^6.3.1",
    "eslint-plugin-react": "^7.20.3",
    "eslint-plugin-react-hooks": "^4.0.5"
```
We can do this by writing on the command line:
``` npm i -D  eslint-config-airbnb eslint-plugin-import eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y eslint-plugin-react eslint-plugin-react-hooks ```
This will install a set of eslint plugins that support Airbnb Style Guide but, will result in compilation error in the browser;
**Failed to compile**
*./node_modules/scheduler/index.js*
*Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/node_modules/scheduler/index.js'*
So we need to add a configuration file *.eslintrc.json* to the root of our project with the following content:
``` {
  "env": {
      "browser": true,
      "es6": true,
      "jest":true
  },
  "extends": [
      "plugin:react/recommended",
      "airbnb"
  ],
  "globals": {
      "Atomics": "readonly",
      "SharedArrayBuffer": "readonly"
  },
  "parserOptions": {
      "ecmaFeatures": {
          "jsx": true
      },
      "ecmaVersion": 2018,
      "sourceType": "module"
  },
  "plugins": [
      "react"
  ],
  "rules": {
} 
```

The configuration sbove is the standard Airbnb dev team. But we also need to enforce the strict use of .jsx files for JSX (instead of being able to use either *.jsx* or *.js*. 
So we change the *rules* thus;

``` "rules": {
    "no-underscore-dangle": [0],
    "react/jsx-props-no-spreading": [0],
    "react/jsx-filename-extension": [
      1,
      {
        "extensions": [".js", ".jsx"]
      }
    ]
  }
} 
```
And so that our linter knows how to handle jest global variables like describe, test, etc: change rules in *.eslintrc.json* *.env* to:

``` "env": {
    "browser": true,
    "es2020": true,
    "jest": true
  }
  ```
## Install Prettier
Because i already use Prettier with VSCode, i just installed a few dependencies with ```npm i -D prettier eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-prettier``` and then update the extends in the .**eslintrc** file with:
``` "extends": [ "airbnb", "plugin:prettier/recommended" ] ```

## Navigation Bar
* Create:
 * a ```<NavBar />``` component which renders a ```<div>```, and import it into your ```<App />```
 * a ```NavBar.css``` file in ```/styles```
 * add logo image inside the <div>
 * add an unordered list inside the <div> with two list elements to  your <ul>. Each list item will be a hyperlink, one with the text "View Properties" and the other with "Add a Property"

**At this point, our app will crash, because hyperlink comes with some import and installations for the browser**.

run ```npm install --save react-router-dom ```
In NavBar.js: ```import { Link } from "react-router-dom";```
In index.js: ``` import { BrowserRouter } from "react-router-dom";```. And wrap App inside ```<BrowserRouter />``` 
So that our App is rendered in *index.js* thus;
``` ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <BrowserRouter>
      <App />
    </BrowserRouter>
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
``` 
We will create two components ```<Properties /> (Homepage) & <Addproperties /> (another page)```

In App.js: ```import { Route, Switch } from "react-router-dom"; ```. And wrap * our ```<Route />``` paths components in ```<Switch />``` component. So that *App.js* looks like so;
```
function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h2>Surreal Estate</h2>

      <NavBar />
      <Switch>
        <Route exact path="/" component={Prpoperties} />
        <Route path="/add-property" component={AddProperty} />
      </Switch>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```
Warapping *Route* in *Switch* make sure that only the page displayed in our browser is the specific page for the *Route path we intend to be*  
```<Switch>``` will render a route exclusively, if there are two componets with the same path, it renders the the first matching one. In contrast to using ```<Route>``` on its own which renders all the matching route inclusively.

Next, we transform ```AddProperty component ``` into a *form, with input field and button* (as controlled components). The form has an initialState of ```key:value pair``` (fields: title: "", .....) So that when the user is typing & before the button is clicked, ```handleFieldChange() function``` is called and updates what happens in that form based on user input. And when the *submit button* is clicked, ``` handleProperty() function``` is called and controls what has happened in that form on subsequent user input

Next, API
We are going to be making use of an already made API.

If you dont already have **Docker Engine** on your computer. Install Docker with: 
```sudo apt install docker.io``` 
Check if docker is installed:
 ```docker --version```

Run this command to download the current stable release of Docker Compose: 

```sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.26.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```
Apply executable permissions to the binary:
```sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose```

Test if Docker Compose is installed:
```$ docker-compose --version
docker-compose version 1.26.2, build 1110ad01
```
* We will be runnning a pre-configured version of the API app and the required database with docker-compose.
* Once docker-comopse is installed, you can start the app and database by running ```docker-compose up``` from the root of this project **In a new terminal tab, change directory into the API folder and run *docker-compose up*. This process fires up a local express server connected to a remote MongoDB database, so you'll need to keep this process running (don't close the tab).**
* Alternately, you can run the app in detached mode by runninng 'docker-compose up -d' from the root of this project
You will not see any output from the containers in detached mode. You can check their logs with ```docker-compose logs SERVICE_NAME```
* You can stop the containers with ```docker-compose stop``` in the root of this project
* You can start them again with ```docker-compose start```
* You can tear down all the containers with ```docker-compose down```, or 
```ctrl c in ther terminal window, if not running in detached mode```

API repository:
clone down the repo:
```git clone git@github.com:MCRcodes/surreal-estate-api.git your project folder name```, ```cd project folder name``` & ```npm i```















Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youâ€™re on your own.

You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t customize it when you are ready for it.
